ABOUT THE PROJECT:
Our land management system makes it easier for users to acquire and sell real estate.The system comes with the following attributes:


 -It enables the user to sign up with previously owned property in the system.

 -Any property in the system may be purchased or sold by the user.

 -User has access to a property's transaction history.

 -To increase the security of the blockchain, we implemented the Proof of Stake (PoS) method.

 -We used the Merkle Tree to calculate the hash of every transaction in a block.

In this system, ZKP (Zero Knowledge Proof) is used.ZKP is used to check the user's password attribute.A user's transaction will be deleted and not added to the blockchain if they are unable to successfully complete a zero knowledge proof to verify their identity.

 - View a Transaction: Every transaction is identified by a unique transaction ID, added by the user itself, and this function uses that ID to print details of a particular transaction(Transaction ID,Buyer Name,Seller Name,Amount,Property Name,Timestamp).
